# Asynchronous Programming

### The Callback Pattern

Callbacks are the materialization of the handlers of the __reactor pattern__. 

They are functions that are invoked to propagate the result of an operation _and this is exactly what we need when dealing with asynchronous operations._

- They replace the use of `return` instruction that always executes synchronously. 

> JavaScript is a great language to represent callbacks, because as we have

> arguments, returned from another function invocation or stored into data structures.**
>
> Another ideal construct for implementing callbacks is closures. **With closures, we can in
> fact reference the environment in which a function was created; we can always maintain the context in which the asynchronous operation was requested**, no matter when or where its callback is invoked.

The presence of a callback in a function signature do not always signify asynchronous behavior. Callbacks can perform one of two purposes:

1. A means to __propagate the result of an asynchronous operation to a handler responsible for processing the operation's result__ 
2. Consider `let doubles = [1,2,3,4].map( num => num*2)`here the callback simply provides the operation to be performed on each element in the array. 

## Listening for Events

### Signals

The Node process object exposes standard __POSIX__ signal names, such that a Node process can subscribe to these system events.â€‹	

### child process communication

### filesystem change events

### deferred execution
