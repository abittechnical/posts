# Medium Clone API

## Dependencies

- `body-parser`
	- Node.js body parsing middleware. 
	- Parse incoming request bodies in a middleware before your handlers, available under the `req.body` property.
- `cors`
	- CORS is a node.js package for providing a [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)/[Express](http://expressjs.com/) middleware that can be used to enable [CORS](http://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Cross-origin_resource_sharing) with various options.
- `dotenv`
	- Dotenv is a zero-dependency module that loads environment variables from a `.env` file into [`process.env`](https://nodejs.org/docs/latest/api/process.html#process_process_env). Storing configuration in the environment separate from code is based on [The Twelve-Factor App](http://12factor.net/config) methodology.
- `ejs`
	- Embedded Javascript templates
- `errorhandler`
	- Development-only error handler middleware.
	- This middleware is only intended to be used in a development environment, as the _full error stack traces and internal details of any object passed to this module_ will be sent back to the client when an error occurs.
- `express`
	-  Fast, unopinionated, minimalist web framework for [node](http://nodejs.org/).******
- `express-jwt*`
	- This module provides Express middleware for validating JWTs ([JSON Web Tokens](https://jwt.io/)) through the [jsonwebtoken](https://github.com/auth0/node-jsonwebtoken/) module. The decoded JWT payload is available on the request object.
- `express-session`
	- Session data middleware for express
- `jsonwebtoken`
	- An implementation of [JSON Web Tokens](https://tools.ietf.org/html/rfc7519).
- `method-override`
	- Lets you use HTTP verbs such as PUT or DELETE in places where the client doesn't support it.
- `methods`
	- HTTP verbs that Node.js core's HTTP parser supports.
- `mongoose`
- Mongoose is a [MongoDB](https://www.mongodb.org/) object modeling tool designed to work in an asynchronous environment. Mongoose supports both promises and callbacks.
- `mongoose-unique-validator`
	- mongoose-unique-validator is a plugin which adds pre-save validation for unique fields within a Mongoose schema.
	- This makes error handling much easier, since you will get a Mongoose validation error when you attempt to violate a [unique constraint](http://mongoosejs.com/docs/api.html#schematype_SchemaType-unique), rather than an E11000 error from MongoDB.
- `morgan`
	- HTTP request logger middleware for node.js
- `passport`
	- Passport is [Express](http://expressjs.com/)-compatible authentication middleware for [Node.js](http://nodejs.org/).
	- Passport's sole purpose is to authenticate requests, which it does through an extensible set of plugins known as _strategies_. Passport does not mount routes or assume any particular database schema, which maximizes flexibility and allows application-level decisions to be made by the developer. The API is simple: you provide Passport a request to authenticate, and Passport provides hooks for controlling what occurs when authentication succeeds or fails.
- `passport-local`
	- [Passport](http://passportjs.org/) strategy for authenticating with a username and password.
	- This module lets you authenticate using a username and password in your Node.js applications. By plugging into Passport, local authentication can be easily and unobtrusively integrated into any application or framework that supports [Connect](http://www.senchalabs.org/connect/)-style middleware, including [Express](http://expressjs.com/).
- `request` (deprecated!)
	- Request is designed to be the simplest way possible to make http calls. It supports HTTPS and follows redirects by default.
- `slug`
	- Slugifies strings, even when they contain Unicode.
	- Make strings URL-safe.
- `underscore`
	- Underscore.js is a utility-belt library for JavaScript that provides support for the usual functional suspects (each, map, reduce, filter...) without extending any core JavaScript objects.
