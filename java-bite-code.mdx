## 1. What is the difference between JDK, JRE, and JVM?
 - **JDK:** This stands for *Java Development Kit*, this is the lanague and associated tools for writing, compiling and executing programs written in the Java Langauage
	 - Not necessary to *run* Java programs. Only needed for development
	 - Comes with the runtime
	 
 - **JRE:** This stands for *Java Runtime Environment*, which is the context in which applications (programs) written in Java are executed. It sits atop the *Java Virtual Machine*. It is an executable program required on a target system to excute your Java code
	 - Required to run Java applications
	 - Runs byte code on the machine it is on
	 - Language agnostic
	 - Contains standalone JVM
 - **JVM:** This stands for *Java Virtual Machine* it is responsible for converting *byte code* which is an intermediary lanaguage Java programs are compiled to that target the JVM.
	 - Runs on a computer any program that's compiled to byte code
	 - It acts like an abstract "virtual" computer
	 - Has byte code loader, verifier and interpreter
	 - Can convert byte code to machine specific code

## 2. What is Java byte code?
> An intermediary language that programs written in Java are compiled to. Byte code targets the JVM

## 4. What are the primitive types in Java?
- `byte`: 8 bit signed integer *range: (-128, 127)*
- `short`: 16 bit signed integer *range: (-32,768, 32,767)*
- `int`: 32 bit signed integer
- `long`: 64 bit signed integer
- `float`: 32 bit signed decimal
- `double`: 64 bit signed decimal
- `boolean`: true or false
- `char`: 16 bit unicode character
